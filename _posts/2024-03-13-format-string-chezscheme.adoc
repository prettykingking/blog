String formatting is used on everyday programming, and it is essential in every
programming language. ChezScheme's implementation of format supports all of the
Common Lisp format directives except for those specific to Common Lisp.

Most useful directives described below. If there is no directive you expected,
please consult https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_c.htm[Common Lisp Hyperspec]
for complete documentation.
