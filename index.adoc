Over the past decade developing Web applications while working in startup companies
through to medium-size institutions. Most of them are data-intensive applications.
In computer science, I am interested in algorithms and data structures.
Believe in efficient software design.

[quote, Bjarne Stroustrup]
Efficiency is not just running fast or running bigger programs,
itâ€™s also running using less resources.

I occasionally write posts in link:/archive/en[English]
